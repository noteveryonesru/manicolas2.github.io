	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
		<p>Hi, there. You're probably wondering who this page belongs to. Well, to start of, my name is Moesha Dane Pangilinan but you can call me "Moe". I am currently residing in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna to fulfill my dream to become a majestical pusheen.</p>
	
	<h3>Why Computer Science?!</h3>
		<p>Even though I generally wanted to take Multimedia Arts, I thought it wouldn't be that bad to learn about Computer Science. I believe it would give me a stepping stone and edge on the career path that I want.</p>
		<p>The crown for my favorite CMSC subject would be CMSC 11. It was one of my first learning experience in programming which I enjoyed back then when CMSC subjects still felt magical to me. I have a love and hate relationship with Assembly. I love the feeling of being able to figure out where I went wrong.</p>
	
	<h3 >What are my interests?</h3>
		<p>I spend most of my free time sleeping, listening to music and watching films.</p>
		<p>If I have to choose one meal that I would have to eat for the rest of my life, I would most probably choose pizza, because pizza is life and life is pizza.</p>
